A custom Compiler in C++. The goal is to learn more about compilers and implement a blazing fast 
deep learning framework on top of it. 

# Roadmap

1. Implement a compiler driver which has custom lexer, parser, assembly generation pass and code emission pass. Since we are not concerned with linking and preprocessing for now, we use their gcc implementations.
