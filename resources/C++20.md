# C++20

A compilation of some C++20 features that I learn while I work on this project. 

1. format : std::format is a new function Introduced in C++20 that provides a way to format strings by replacing placeholders inside a format string with the values of the provided arguments. The placeholders are represented using “{}” inside the format string. 

```cpp
std::string scarlet =  std::format(std::string_view format_string, Args... args);
// here format_string can be "hello {}" and args can be "World".
```

2. span : gives a non owning reference of a contiguous data structure. 

```cpp
int main() 
{ 
    vector<int> vec = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; 
    span<int> span_vec(vec);
    std::span<int> subspan = span_vec.subspan(1, 3); 
}

```

3. enum class : `enum` and `enum class` differ in their scope. So the members of enum has the same scope as the enum and hence we can access them directly from their name. While to access the members of an enum class, we need to use the scope resolution `::` on the class. 

4. About the nature of `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast`:

a. `static_cast`:
- Performs compile-time casting
- Does not perform any runtime checks
- Trusts that you (the programmer) know what you're doing
- Will happily let you shoot yourself in the foot
- Works even without virtual functions in the base class

b. `dynamic_cast`:
- Performs runtime type checking
- Requires Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)
- Requires the base class to have at least one virtual function
- Actually checks if the cast is valid at runtime
- Returns nullptr (for pointers) or throws bad_cast (for references) if the cast isn't valid

For Example: 
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<base> b = std::make_shared<base>();
// This compiles but is unsafe:
std::shared_ptr<derived> d = std::static_pointer_cast<derived>(b);
// This would fail (return nullptr):
std::shared_ptr<derived> d = std::dynamic_pointer_cast<derived>(b);
```

`static_cast` "works" (compiles and runs) because it's just doing pointer arithmetic and type reinterpretation at compile time. It's like telling the compiler "trust me, I know this base pointer really points to a derived object" - even though that's not true!

`dynamic_cast` fails because it actually checks at runtime and sees "hey, this is really just a base object, not a derived object" and returns nullptr.
