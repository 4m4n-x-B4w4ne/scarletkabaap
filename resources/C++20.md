# C++20

A compilation of some C++20 features that I learn while I work on this project. 

1. format : std::format is a new function Introduced in C++20 that provides a way to format strings by replacing placeholders inside a format string with the values of the provided arguments. The placeholders are represented using “{}” inside the format string. 

```cpp
std::string scarlet =  std::format(std::string_view format_string, Args... args);
// here format_string can be "hello {}" and args can be "World".
```

2. span : gives a non owning reference of a contiguous data structure. 

```cpp
int main() 
{ 
    vector<int> vec = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; 
    span<int> span_vec(vec);
    std::span<int> subspan = span_vec.subspan(1, 3); 
}

```

3. enum class : `enum` and `enum class` differ in their scope. So the members of enum has the same scope as the enum and hence we can access them directly from their name. While to access the members of an enum class, we need to use the scope resolution `::` on the class.
